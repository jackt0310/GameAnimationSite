        <!-- Objective -->
        <div>
            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>Basic objective of Maze Explorer is to find the key hidden in the auto-generated maze and to then escape the maze. The play will start in an auto generated maze and the player will use the WASD keys to move around the maze and the mouse to move the camera around. The key will use particle animations to make it look important. Once the key is found the player picks up the key and then finds the end of the maze. Ghosts will be floating throughout the maze in the game trying to find the player, the ghosts will injure the player if caught. The player can use multiple weapons including a sword, arrows, and holy hand grenades to defend himself against the ghosts. Chests can be found throughout the maze that hold weapons, new background songs, gold, and health upgrades. The tavern can be navigated to from the main menu, in the tavern the player can purchase weapon upgrades, health upgrades, and new songs with the gold the player has collected in the game.</p>

        <!-- Framework -->
        <div>
            <h1>Framework</h1>
            <h3>Player Animation Script</h3>
            <p>Player aniamtions include an idle state, a walking state, a rolling state, a standing sword attack, and a walking sword attack. All animation was done using blender and imported to Unity.</p>
            <h3>Maze Generation Script</h3>
            <p>The mazes are generated using the hunt and kill algorithm. Each maze is unique and is generated upon start or the game, player death, and different levels. The walls and floors are prefabs that the algorithm uses to put together to make the maze. Both walls and floors have their own textures. Every maze is a perfect maze, only one path to the exit.</p>
            <h3>Enemies</h3>
            <p>Ghosts are set to hover through the maze toward the character. They reduce the health of the character if within a certain distance, or they kill the character restarting the level.</p>
            <h3>Tavern</h3>
            <p>The tavern was off of the unity asset store. The characters inside the tavern are also from the asset store. Unity collision handler was used on the stools so you can kick them around.</p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Background music and sound effects were done by importing .wav files and using Unity Audio Source object to control sound.</p>
            <h3>Chests</h3>
            <p>Chests were randomly placed throughout the maze with random items inside. A breakdown of the items can be found in the "Other" Section.</p>
